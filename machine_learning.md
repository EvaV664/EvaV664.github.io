# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Fundamentals

Over the summer, I studied the fundamentals of **machine learning** for both **regression** and **classification**, applying concepts through interactive exercises and programming projects.

## Regression
- Linear regression  
- Loss functions  
- Model parameters  
- Gradient descent  
- Hyperparameters  
- Logistic regression with probability calculation, loss, and regularization  

## Classification
- Thresholds and decision boundaries  
- Confusion matrix  
- Accuracy, precision, recall  
- ROC/AUC  
- Prediction bias  
- Multi-class classification  

I applied these concepts through hands-on programming exercises and projects, building a foundation to explore more advanced machine learning techniques and real-world applications.
